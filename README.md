# Stylelint browser demo

This project is based on https://github.com/m-allanson/stylelint-browser-demo

This project demonstrates how we can use stylelint 9.10.1 in browser.

# Getting started

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

# How it works

Webpack is used to bundle stylelint and its dependencies into a single file. The build config ignores or replaces unnecessary and incompatible dependencies.
